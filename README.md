## Notes & Tips

- **Google Search 429 Error:**
  > ‚ùå An error occurred during Google Search: 429 Client Error: Too Many Requests ...
  - This is due to rate-limiting by Google (since we use `googlesearch-python` as a workaround for not using a paid SERP API). If you see this, just retry (it usually works after 2-4 tries).

- **URL Limit:**
  - By default, only 2 URLs are scraped per search for speed and to avoid Gemini API quota issues. You can increase this in `main.py` (`NUM_SEARCH_RESULTS`), but be aware of API usage if on a free tier.

- **Why browser_use + Gemini?**
  - Other approaches (Groq+Llama3, Mavericka, Scout, Selenium+heuristics) were tested but failed on context size, reliability, or dynamic content. 
    
    browser_use with Gemini along {gemini-2.5-flash} model is the most robust for real-world e-commerce scraping.We can try it out with gemini-2.5-pro as well.
